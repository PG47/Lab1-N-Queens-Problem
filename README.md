# Lab1-N-Queens-Problem

Considering the N-queens problem, in which
• The complete-state formulation represents a configuration, i.e., all the N queens are on the
board. Furthermore, each queen is on a separate column.
• The successors of any state are all possible configurations generated by moving a single queen
to another square in the same column.
You need to solve the above problem by implementing the following search algorithms.
• Uniform-cost search,
• Graph-search A* with MIN-CONFLICT heuristic: “the number of ATTACKING pairs of queens”,
• Genetic algorithm with the objective function defined from the above heuristic.

The code will accept the number of queens, N, and a positive integer indicating the algorithm (1: uniform-cost search, 2: A*, 3: genetic algorithm).
Also for each algorithm choice, the code wil randomly create 3 different test case and show out the time running to complete each test
